##### By **Rhoda Kimanga (RK Nyra)**

### Description
This is a GitHub Search app [ghSearch] (insert quote-app live link here) that enables the search of github users and public repositories. You can view it [ghSearch] (insert quote-app live link here).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4.


### Setup/Installation Requirements
* Github account - from where the site's source-code and live-site can be viewed and downloaded
* Git installed in pc - for downloading the site to view it locally i.e. on one's device
* Text Editor e.g. Visual Studio or Atom - for making viewing and editing the code.
* Browser e.g. Google Chrome - which can be used to open the index.html file once it has been downloaded

###### Development server
* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

###### Code scaffolding
* Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build
* Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


### Behavior Driven Development
1. On getting to the landing page, a user is able to view a currently displayed github user profile with respective public repositories.
2. The user is able to navigate to other pages (About, Explore/Search) using the navigation bar.
3. On navigating to the Explore/Search section, the user can use the search bar to key-in their search query and the results are then displayed below the search bar. 
4.The app allows the user to search either by github usernames or repository-names.
